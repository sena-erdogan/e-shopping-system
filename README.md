# e-shopping-system

An e-shopping application that has two user roles: traders and customers.
Users authenticate to the system by using their user IDs and passwords. 
The user ID is an eight-digit unique number and the password consists of six characters. 
After the authentication process is done properly, the program shows a menu to the users with respect to their user role. 

- Traders add, remove, and edit products on their shop. Each product has a unique ID, a
hierarchical category, a name, a description, a price, and a discount amount.
- Traders see the list of orders from customers and can meet or cancel the orders.
- Customers can search and query the products by their names. The products that contain the search text in their name or description should be returned in the results.
- The search results are shown in decreasing order of the product name. Customers can sort the products in the search results by their prices, the percentage of the discount, or the name.
- The search results can be filtered by their category or the prices with respect to given upper or lower (or both) thresholds. The customer can filter the products not only in the lowest level category but also in any higher-level category.
- Customers can display all the products of a trader.
